 * @version (1.0 18/11/19)
 * 
 * Class Browser adds the functionality to create browsers object which represent potential
 * customers for the Website object. The class contain 5 variables for ID, email, 
 * yearOfBirth, isBuyer, wineCase, website. The value of the ID is generated with
 * the help of the Random class. While the second 2 variables receive their values from the 
 * constructor, the last 2 wineCase and website receive their values from the WineCase
 * and Website object respectively.
 * 
 * There are 3 constructors, first of which is default and is hard-coded while
 * the following 2 expecting values for email, yearOfBirth and iD just for the last
 * one.
 * 
 * There are 5 accessor method that return for the iD, email, yearOfBirth, isBuyer
 * and wineCase fields.
 * 
 * There are 6 mutator method within this class, first of which allow us to amend 
 * the iD of the browser. The second method allow us to switch the isBuyer value.
 * The following method editDetails it wasn't requested, however, I found it helpful
 * while testing the age restriction and seems logical browser to be able to amend 
 * its details, therefore I decide to leave it as it is. The next mutator method is
 * the selectWineCase which allow the browser to select object from the WineCase 
 * class it browser is buyer and print message in the terminal window. Next method
 * payForWine call the checkout method from the Website object which is followed
 * by a thank you message in the terminal window. This method also call the newSale 
 * method from the Website object to amend the sales total. Last but not least, the 
 * setWebsite method is accessed from the Website object to amend the value of the 
 * website field.
